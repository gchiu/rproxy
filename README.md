# rproxy
Rebol web proxy

An experiment to see if a Rebol web server, particularly ren-cc, can be used as a web proxy to help automatically login to web sites and scrape data automatically.

The website will be loaded into an iframe and the outer will contain the rebol wasm to help control the DOM.
